# FSP - ASL fingerspelling practice tool

American Sign Language (ASL) fingerspelling practice tool prototype built based on [Dr. Bill Vicars practice tool](https://asl.ms/) but using a 3D animated hand scan instead of pictures.

The hand contains 400+ animations and allows to practice viewing the hand from different angles as well as see the in-between motions when transitioning between letters. The large animation count comes from transitional animations - these are used to prevent fingers from clipping and make the motions more natural.

**NOTE:** This tool should be treated solely as a technical demo or a proof of concept. It is not meant to serve as an actual learning source. It is yet to be reviewed by a qualified source and the signs shown may not be entirely correct. Additionally, a lot of the animations are rather rough around the edges serving only as a placeholder.

The word list used for fingerspelling is a slightly modified version of the [10000 most common English words list](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english/blob/master/google-10000-english-no-swears.txt).
